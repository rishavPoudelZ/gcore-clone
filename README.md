!!For anyone trying to donwload my project just make sure to keep all the files in same directory.

Just found [gcore.com](https://gcore.com/) site randomly going thrugh internet and decided to clone it's landing 
page. At first the idea looked simple but thenn I decided to also clone the animation that happens on hover 
over the little dots. I also had to go and mix some of javascript for the animation to get up and running. I tried
my best to clone the actual site. This project was a lot of fun!
